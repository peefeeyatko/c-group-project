Fundamentals of C Programming - Group Project
=============================================

### Assesment Task:

In this research-inspired project, students will work together in teams to develop a professional grade program that manipulates real-world data. You will develop team working skills, project management skills and communication skills.

### Project Description:

Our customer is a very security conscious designer who likes to protect the intellectual property of the images which they create for work and personal use. The problem is our customer would like to store images online and in the cloud for portability and ease of access but before uploading would like to know the images are fully encrypted. The customer would ideally like a way to simply encrypt one or more images before uploading them online and then a way to decrypt the images when accessed from another machine.

Our solution to this problem will involve creating a C program to encrypt BMP image files through a helpful CLI (command line interface). The CLI will provide a user friendly menu for choosing options as well as a feature to compress all encrypted images into a single zip file for storage.

##### Scope including main features for development;
 
* Interacting with a menu system through a CLI
* Ability to encrypt one or more .bmp image files
* Ability to decrypt one or more .bmp image files
* Check for a password before decrypting  images
* Ability to update password
* Ability to compress all images into a zip file


### Project Instructions:

1. git clone project or download ZIP [https://github.com/peefeeyatko/c-group-project]
2. `cd c-group-project`
3. to compile type command `make`
4. to run executable type command `./main.out`
